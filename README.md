# aws-sns-mock-test
it's sample project to understand how mock works with aws.
Example with SNS. 

## Purpose 

Succeed to make sure that the sns message is sent with specific parameter by calling `snsService.publishMessage()`

## Installation

run : 
`npm install`

## Folder /succeed

In this case, we import SNS by `import {Â SNS } from 'aws-sdk';`
That works as expected.

run: 
```
npm run test-succeed
```


## Folder /failure

In this case, we import SNS by `import SNS from 'aws-sdk/clients/sns';`
Impossible to make it work.

Two ways  to test it : 

- Method1 : By just using jest.
- Method2 : By using a third lib, called `jest-aws-sdk-mock`

run: 
```
npm run test-failure
```
